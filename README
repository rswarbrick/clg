This package contains Common Lisp bindings to GTK+ v2.0. It currently
only works with CMUCL 19a, but ports to other CL implementations may
be added later.

Build instructions
------------------

1. When building for CMUCL, first obtain a matching binary and source
   tree (the only source file you will actually need is lisp.h and a
   couple of other header files). On ELF systems you may also have to
   rebuild lisp with -rdynamic added to OS_LINK_FLAGS.


2. Set up paths to reflect your system:

   - Add a logical-pathname-translation to clg in ~/.cmucl-init.lisp
     or some other startup file. Example:

       (setf
         (logical-pathname-translations "clg")
         '(("**;*.*.*" "/home/espen/src/clg/**/")))

   - Set the correct pkg-config search path if your gtk+ installation
     is in an unusual place, by adding it to the PKG_CONFIG_PATH
     environment variable before starting lisp.

   - Set *cmucl-include-path* to point to the directory where the
     lisp.h file resides, if it is not in the default place.  Try "locate 
     'lisp/lisp.h'" if you don't know the location.


3. Compile and load the system:
   
     (asdf:oos 'asdf:load-op :gtk)

   Currently it will fail with:

   Error in function KERNEL::%REDEFINE-DEFSTRUCT:
     Redefining class PCL::SLOT-INFO incompatibly with the current definition.

   Just accept the redefinition (restart 1) to continue building or loading.


4. If everything worked, try (load "hello-world") to see a small
   window pop up, and then run testgtk.lisp in the example directory.
