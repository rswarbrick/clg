Build instructions
------------------

1. When building for CMUCL, first obtain a matching binary and source
   tree (the only source file you will actually need is lisp.h, which
   have to be copied or linked to your CMUCL_LIB directory).  On ELF
   systems you may also have to rebuild lisp with -rdynamic added to
   OS_LINK_FLAGS.
