This package contains Common Lisp bindings to GTK+ v2.x. It currently
only works with CMUCL 19a and SBCL (0.8.21), but ports to other CL
implementations may be added later.


New versions
------------

The most recent version of this package can be downloaded from
http://sourceforge.net/projects/clg.



Build instructions
------------------

1. When building for SBCL you first need to add callback support,
   since SBCL does not yet has a native callback facility. The
   following instructions are borrowed from the Common Music
   installation guide:

   1. Download Thomas Burdick's Alien Function package¹ and restore it 
      to a directory on your machine.
   2. Compile the Alien Function package and save a new sbcl.core image:

      $ cd sbcl-af
      $ sbcl --load "system"
      * (sb-ext:save-lisp-and-die "/tmp/sbcl.core")
      $ cd /usr/local/lib/sbcl
      $ cp sbcl.core sbcl.core.orig
      $ mv /tmp/sbcl.core .


   ¹ A slightly modified version which works with SBCL 0.8.21 or newer
     could be found at 
     http://jupiter.td.org.uit.no/lisp/sbcl-0.8.21-af.tar.gz


2. Set up paths to match your system:

   - Add a logical-pathname-translation to the clg root directory in
     ~/.cmucl-init.lisp, ~/.sbclrc or some other startup file, like
     this:

       (setf
         (logical-pathname-translations "clg")
         '(("**;*.*.*" "/home/espen/src/clg/**/")))

   - Set the correct pkg-config search path if your Gtk+ installation
     is in an unusual place, by adding it to the PKG_CONFIG_PATH
     environment variable before starting lisp.

   - Make sure ASDF finds the system definition files:
       
       (push 
	#+sbcl(truename #p"clg:systems") 
	#+cmu(concatenate 'string (unix-namestring #p"clg:systems") "/")
	asdf:*central-registry*)

     When checking out of CVS also do the following:
     $ cd <clg toplevel>
     $ mkdir systems && cd systems
     $ find .. -name '*.asd' -exec ln -s {} . \;


3. Compile and load the system:
   
     (asdf:oos 'asdf:load-op :gtk)

   In CMUCL 19a this will fail with:

   Error in function KERNEL::%REDEFINE-DEFSTRUCT:
     Redefining class PCL::SLOT-INFO incompatibly with the current definition.

   Just accept the redefinition (restart 1) to continue building or
   loading. To avoid doing this every time clg is loaded, compile
   and load glib/pcl.lisp in newly started CMUCL process and save a
   new core image.

   If you are running SBCL with Slime you need to put the following
   in ~/.swank.lisp to prevent Slime from spawning multiple
   threads, since GTK+ is not really thread safe:

     #+sbcl(setq swank:*communication-style* :fd-handler)


4. If everything worked, try (load "hello-world") to see a small
   window pop up, and then run testgtk.lisp in the example directory.



Guidelines for using the GTK+ API documentation 
-----------------------------------------------

Here are some brief guidelines for using the GTK+ API documentation. A
lot of (both intentional and unintentional) inconsistencies exists,
so it is also wise to check the source code.

- library prefixes are stripped from all symbols

- the get/set part are removed from regular accessors, but retained
  in functions which set or retrieve multiple values

- predicate functions follow the normal convention of ending
  with '-P'

- if there are multiple similar named functions which only differ in
  the type of argument they accept, only one function accepting any
  kind of valid argument types is provided

- there are no gtk_*_new functions, use MAKE-INSTANCE to create widgets

- all object properties are available as virtual slots. A lot of
  "missing" properties are manually defined as slots

- use CHILD-PROPERTY-VALUE or automatically defined accessors to
  access child properties

- use STYLE-PROPERTY-VALUE to access style properties

- the only function used to connect signals is SIGNAL-CONNECT
