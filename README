This package contains Common Lisp bindings to GTK+ v2.0. It currently
only works with CMUCL, but ports to other CL implementations may be
added later.

Build instructions
------------------

1. When building for CMUCL, first obtain a matching binary and source
   tree (the only source file you will actually need is lisp.h, which
   have to be copied or linked to your CMUCL_LIB directory).  On ELF
   systems you may also have to rebuild lisp with -rdynamic added to
   OS_LINK_FLAGS.

2. Edit clg.system to reflect the paths on your system:

   - Edit the logical-pathname-translations to point to the
     place where the sources actually are, or set the translations
     somewhere else, like ~/.cmucl-init.lisp.

   - Edit the pkg-config search path if your gtk+ installation is in 
     an unusual place.

   - Edit *cmucl-include-path* to point to the directory where the
     lisp.h file resides, if it is not auto detected.  Try "locate 
     '*/lisp.h'" if you don't know the location.

3. Compile and load clg:
   (load "clg.system")
   (mk:oos :clg :compile)
   (mk:oos :clg :load)

4. If everything worked, try (load "hello-world") to see a small
   window pop up.
